Fullworks Vulnerability Scanner examines your Core version, themes and plugins and reports on any issues detected by referencing the WordPress Vulnerability Database API and checking for abandoned plugins and themes.

== Description ==

This plugin checks your WordPress Core version, installed themes, and plugins, and generates a detailed report of any vulnerabilities found and emails to notify you that there is something to check. The scan results are obtained by referencing the comprehensive [WordPress Vulnerability Database API](https://vulnerability.wpsysadmin.com/).

Additionally, Fullworks Vulnerability Scanner will also alert you of any abandoned plugins or themes, which can pose a potential security risk to your website. With this plugin, you can easily keep your website secure and reduce the risk of security breaches.
